(Please put down kind of what you have done in relation to learning about Unity/Github/any other tools. We should have about the same stuff so dont worry)

** Explains why we are confident in working in our development environment. **
(feel free to add anything/reasons that arent already mentioned)
We are confident because we understand the basics and know how to get around the environments.
We also know where to find resourses to help answer any questions that will inevitibly come up during the project. 



**Difficulties encountered**
(feel free to add anything/reasons that arent already mentioned)
Because we were all relatively new to the different environments, we didn't understand how things worked and couldn't help each other either.



**How difficulties were resolved.**
(feel free to add anything/reasons that arent already mentioned)
After going throught some basic tutorials on our own, we were able to talk about what we learnt to consolidate our group knowledge on the environments.



**Resources used and how the team helped each other.**
(feel free to add anything/reasons that arent already mentioned)
The resourses we used included Video tutorials from Youtube and Lynda. There were also text based tutorials built into the Github and Unity environments.
We were able to help each other by explaining what we learnt on our own. This helped fill an any gaps in our basic knowledge, and also let us know where to find helpful resourses in the future.
